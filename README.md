# mojo-cli

Command Line Interface for Mojo.sh.

Mojo is currently in development. Enter at your own risk.

## Setup

Because Mojo is currently under development, an npm package has not been created.

Install the CLI

`npm install -g joelnet/mojo-cli`

Register a Mojo.sh account

`mojo register -u <username> -e <email> -p <password>`

Create your first realm. In this example, we'll call it default.

`mojo realm add default`
